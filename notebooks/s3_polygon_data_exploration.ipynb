    "## üåê Understanding Requests and Paginators in S3 (Conceptual Overview)\n",
    "\n",
    "### üì§ What is a Request?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **request** is a single operation sent from your client (e.g., Python code) to a server (e.g., AWS S3 or Polygon‚Äôs S3-compatible endpoint). For example, when you ask to list files in a folder-like structure in a bucket, that is a request.\n",
    "\n",
    "S3‚Äôs `list_objects_v2` request returns a maximum of 1000 objects (files) at a time. If more files exist, it only returns the first \"page\" and indicates that more data is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÅ What is a Paginator?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **paginator** is a built-in tool provided by `boto3` that automatically handles repeated requests when the response is paginated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually tracking continuation tokens and sending new requests, the paginator transparently performs this for you. It lets you iterate over all the data as if it were returned in one big response.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü™£ S3 Paginators Specifically\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 paginators are used to retrieve more than 1000 files (objects) from a bucket. You create a paginator specifically for the `list_objects_v2` operation, which is the improved version of the original S3 listing API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paginator handles:\n",
    "- Sending the first request\n",
    "- Detecting if the result is truncated (chopped off)\n",
    "- Sending follow-up requests with the continuation token\n",
    "- Returning each full page of results one after the other\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Key Parameters Used with S3 Paginators\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bucket**: The name of the S3 bucket you are querying.\n",
    "- **Prefix**: A folder-like path that limits the results to objects that begin with that string.\n",
    "- **Delimiter** (optional): Used to group files as if they were in folders (commonly set to `/`).\n",
    "- **PaginationConfig** (optional): Allows advanced control, like page size or starting from a specific point.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **request** retrieves a single chunk of data from S3.\n",
    "- A **paginator** automates multiple requests so you can work with large datasets easily.\n",
    "- S3 paginators are essential when listing more than 1000 files in a bucket or folder-like structure.\n"
